selecting a class summary -> sometimes (usually at very very beggining) shows that the class was selected (by having a blue underline) and then refreshes back to monthly summaty page and not the students in the class summary

that may be because it thinks there is no data in class summary page in which case we told it to go back.

*) check dates on excel 
*) make sure that fetches don't bring information we don't need (like on the FAJRESes)
