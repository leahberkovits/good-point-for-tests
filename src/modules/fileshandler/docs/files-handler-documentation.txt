                                Files Handler Documentation                                 
____________________________________________________________________________________________




** Uploading files to the system **
_______________________________________________________________


The files types are: - Images (png, jpg, jpeg, gif, svg)
					 - Files  (docx, doc, pdf, wav)
				  	 - Audio  (mp3, webm, wav)
				  	 - Video  (mp4, webm, ogg, avi)


** Note: - The documentation will use "image" as an example to all file types
         - It will use Games model as an example to models that save files



1. Uploading the image

import ImageUploader from '...../src/modules/fileshandler/client/components/ImageUploader';
																			FileUploader
																			AudioUploader
																			VideoUploader

<ImageUploader
    category="string"
    thumbnail={<img />}
    defaultValue={<img />}
    name="string"
    required={boolean}
    onChange={function()}
    label="string"
    title="sting"
	description="string"
    removeFileIcon=<html/> || "string"
/>

Let's break it down and describe each prop:

._______________._________._______________________________________________________________________.__________._________________.
| Prop			| Type	  | What it does														  | Required | File types      |
._______________._________._______________________________________________________________________.__________._________________.
| category      | string  | the name of the folder the image will be saved in 	    			  | yes		 | All			   |
| thumbnail     | html    | the image that you will show if user didn't upload any image yet 	  | no		 | Image,Video	   | 
| defaultValue  | html	  | the default image you will display (ex. previous uploaded image) 	  | no		 | All			   |
| name          | string  | the name of the column in database where you want to save the image id| yes		 | All			   |
| required      | boolean | if the uploaded is required or not							 		  | no		 | All			   |
| onChange      | function| the final event object of the image will be sent to this function	  | yes		 | All			   |
| label		    | string  | the label that will be displayed with the uploader					  | no		 | All			   |
| title		    | string  | the title to save in database									 	  | no		 | All			   |
| description   | string  | the description to save in database									  | no		 | All			   |
| removeFileIcon| html    | the image that you will show if user didn't upload any image yet 	  | no		 | Image,File,Video|
._______________._________._______________________________________________________________________.__________._________________.



2. Saving the image

The onChange function you pass to the uploader as props get an event object (eventObj) as a parameter.

You need to pass that eventObj "as is" to your post method.

We are saving the image inside the save procedure of other models different than "image.js"

The save process takes place into a form for a specific model (e.g: games)

Meaning, you do NOT have to post directly to Images model, but you can post to other models too.



3. The FilesHandler mixin

There is a mixin that launches everytime any request takes place on the server : mixin/FilesHandler.js

The mixin launches on any request only for specified models.

This mixin's role is to detect if we have inside the data fields any field of type File 

The field type file could be of three diferent types: Audio, Files, Images.


	* Setting up a model to launch the FilesHandler mixin: (ex. Games model)

        Games.json
        {
            .....
            "mixins": {
                "FilesHandler": true
            },
            .....
        }
	


4. FilesHandler detects any of the file types to save according to the eventObj we send it.

Example of a data set: 

We want to save data set into model: Games
    
    {
        gameName: "best game on earth",
        numOfPlayers: 4,
        gameImage: {
            type: "image" (this value is a const!),
            src: "data:image/png;base64,ADOJSAIFDMKCSMNCIDMCJSM (base 64 content for the image)",
            category: "animals" (the name of folder where the image is saved- required!),
            title: "this is the title if exists",
            description: "this is the description if exists"
        },
        anotherImage: {
            type:"image" (this value is a const!),
            src:"data:image/jpeg;base64,SDFJSDIFJSDFIJWEIFJEWIF (base 64 content for the image)",
            category:"people"
        }
    }

If the type is "image", the fileHandler saves the image into Images model.

(It saves the other files into the respective models).



5. What does the saving process include: 

    a. Additional entry will be added to Files/Images models with ownerId (current user id) - this is why we need to pass "options" tp the remote method

    b. The image will be saved into /public/images/CATEGORY/[IMAGE_ID].jpg/png/gif/etc

    c. in the specific model (in our example it is games), only the relation will be saved, e.g: anotherImage:6

    d. Permissions for the owner (current user id) of the image will be set in records_permissions model



6. Behind the scenes of FilesHandler mixin: (always good to know what's happening)

Before your remote fires the fileshandler beforeRemote('*') launches.

It detects the files according to the types in the eventObj and saves them in a field named "filesToSave".

Then it changes the value of the key holding the object to null. (This is why the field in database should be "default null").

At this point the beforeRemote finishes its job and your method/remote method launches.

Once it is finished, the fileshandler afterRemote('*') launches.

It uses the "filesToSave" to find the file to save.

According to the type if the file it knows in which model to save it.

Now read step 5, points a-d, (it explains what happens next)

If you have a function named "afterFilesHandler" in your model (the one that does the initial post) it will launch now.

This was a small taste of what the FilesHandler mixin does.




** Important things to check if stuff doesn't work :)

    a. The column in database where you save the image id is set to "default null".

    b. If you are using a remote method to save the image, one of its properties is "options"

        ex.

        Games.exampleMethodWithOptions=(gameId, options, cb)=>{
            const token = options && options.accessToken;
            const userId = token && token.userId;
            if (!userId) return cb("AUTHORIZATION_ERROR", null);
            
            .....
        }

        Games.remoteMethod('exampleMethodWithOptions', {
            http: { verb: 'get', path: '/exampleMethodWithOptions' },
            accepts: [
                { "arg": "gameId", "type": "number", "required": true },
                { "arg": "options", "type": "object", "http": "optionsFromRequest" }
            ],
            returns: { arg: 'res', type: 'object', root: true }
        });

    c. Make sure the method is one of the following: POST, PATCH, PUT. (otherwise the fileshandler won't launch)

       d. Make sure that the name of the column you want to save the image to is not the same as the name (key) of one of the relations

        ex.

        Bad:
       
            "relations": {
                "mainImage": {...}
            },
            "properties": {
                "mainImage": "number",
                ...
            }, ...

        Good:

            "relations": {
                "MainImage": {...}
            },
            "properties": {
                "mainImage": "number",
                ...
            }, ...
